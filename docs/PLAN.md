# Plan

## Current phase

Site in production; content and minor improvements as needed. No formal slices in progress.

## Slices

| Slice | Goal | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| — | Marketing site live (hero, programme, stages, tarifs, témoignages, modals, deploy) | Done |

## Tasks

- [ ] (Optional) Restore or add testimonial entries in `assets/data/temoignages.json` if carousel is desired; schema in `docs/temoignages-carousel.md`, backup in `docs/temoignages-sauvegarde.json` if needed.
- [ ] (Ongoing) Content and date updates as festival approaches (e.g. 2026-05-15 to 2026-05-17).

No other active delivery tasks at this time. Use this file to track new slices or tasks when they are defined.
