# Plan

## Current phase

Site in production; content and minor improvements as needed. No formal slices in progress.

## Slices

| Slice | Goal | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| — | Marketing site live (hero, programme, stages, tarifs, témoignages, modals, deploy) | Done |
| Fullscreen programme — animations and auto-schedule | Add per-block animation/carousel when an event is selected in fullscreen, and time-based auto-schedule on show days; keep existing layout and day/event selection unchanged. No animation during shows. | Planned |

See [Slices (detail)](#slices-detail) below for full behaviour.
